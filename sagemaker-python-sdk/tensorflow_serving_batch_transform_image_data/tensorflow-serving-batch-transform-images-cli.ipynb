    "In this notebook, we'll show how to use SageMaker batch transform to get inferences on a large datasets. To do this, we'll use a TensorFlow Serving model to do batch inference on a large dataset of images. We'll show how to use the new pre-processing and post-processing feature of the TensorFlow Serving container on Amazon SageMaker so that your TensorFlow model can make inferences directly on data in S3, and save post-processed inferences to S3.\n",

This subset consists of 100,00 images in .jpg format, for a total of 10GB. For demonstration, the [model](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/resnet#pre-trained-model) we'll be using is an image classification model based on the ResNet-50 architecture that has been trained on the ImageNet dataset, and which has been exported as a TensorFlow SavedModel.\n",

We'll write a pre- and post-processing script and package the script with our TensorFlow SavedModel, and demonstrate how to get inferences on large datasets with SageMaker batch transform quickly, efficiently, and at scale, on GPU-accelerated instances."

    "### Creating a Model and Running a Transform Job\n",

    "The code below creates a SageMaker Model entity that will be used for Batch inference, and runs a Transform Job using that Model. The Model contains a reference to the TFS container, and the `model.tar.gz` containing our TensorFlow SavedModel and the pre- and post-processing `inference.py` script.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we create a SageMaker Model, we use it to run batch predictions using Batch Transform. We specify the input S3 data, content type of the input data, the output S3 data, and instance type and count.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "For improved performance, we specify two additional parameters `max_concurrent_transforms` and `max_payload`, which control the maximum number of parallel requests that can be sent to each instance in a transform job at a time, and the maximum size of each request body.\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing inference on entire S3 objects that cannot be split by newline characters, such as images, it is recommended that you set `max_payload` to be slightly larger than the largest S3 object in your dataset, and that you experiment with the `max_concurrent_transforms` parameter in powers of two to find a value that maximizes throughput for your model. For example, we’ve set `max_concurrent_transforms` to 64 after experimenting with powers of two, and we set `max_payload` to 1, since the largest object in our S3 input is less than one megabyte."

    "SageMaker batch transform can transform large datasets quickly and scalably. We used the SageMaker TensorFlow Serving Container to demonstrate how to quickly get inferences on a hundred thousand images using GPU-accelerated instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Amazon SageMaker TFS container supports CSV and JSON data out of the box. The pre- and post-processing feature of the container lets you run transform jobs on data of any format. The same container can be used for real-time inference as well using an Amazon SageMaker hosted model endpoint."
